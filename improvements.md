##Items I would have implemented given more time:

#### General:
- set up continuous integration with Jenkins

####App:
- add configuration option for e2e tests to choose executable based on user operating system
- add functionality to sort a transactions file by date

####Tests:
- add logging in order to have more readable info about failed tests.
