Items I would have implemented given more time

# set up continuous integration with Jenkins
# add reporting

app:
# add configuration option for e2e tests to choose executable based on user os
# add functionality to sort a transactions file by date

tests:
# verify big files are handled correctly (how to generate a REALLY big file)
# take test data out to a config file in order not to keep them hardcoded in the tests file
# add logging in order to have more readable info about failed tests
